MuleSoft CRUD Operations Project: Favorite Movies Database

In this project, I developed a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system to manage movie records using Java and SQLite as part of a MuleSoft integration. The project involved building the following functionalities:

Create Table: Established a movie database with fields such as movie name, lead actor, lead actress, year of release, and director name.
Insert Records: Implemented functionality to insert new movie records into the database, including user input for movie details like actor, actress, and director names.
Select All Records: Developed a retrieval mechanism to fetch all movie records and display them in a structured format.
Filter Records by Actor: Added the ability to search for movies based on the lead actorâ€™s name using SQL queries.
Database Connection: Utilized JDBC for seamless communication with the SQLite database, ensuring reliable operations.
This project helped me refine my skills in database management, SQL query optimization, and CRUD operations, as well as gain insights into API-driven data handling within MuleSoft.
